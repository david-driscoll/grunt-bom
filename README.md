# grunt-bom

A Byte Order Mark removal task for grunt.

## WARNING
As a note it does a direct rewrite of the file, just without the BOM, please make sure you have tested grunt-bom before using it any code, just in case for some reason it decides to eat your code for lunch.

## Getting Started
Install this grunt plugin next to your project's [grunt.js gruntfile][getting_started] with: `npm install grunt-bom`

Then add this line to your project's `grunt.js` gruntfile:

```javascript
grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-bom');
```
